# Controller tuning activity: PID and Pure Pursuit controller for fastest lap time

## THIS README FILE IS IN PROGRESS

# To test the code:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements from requirements.txt (Might need to check these requirements work for you and I didnt forget any)
3. Edit the controller parameters in *src/config/controller_params.py*
4. Run the simulation to visualise the controller performance by running the *src/run.py* file
